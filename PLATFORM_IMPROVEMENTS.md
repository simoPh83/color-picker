# Platform-Aware Screen Capture Implementation

## Overview
The Color Picker now includes intelligent platform detection that optimizes screen capture methods based on the operating system, eliminating unnecessary API calls and improving performance.

## Platform Detection
- **macOS**: Uses MSS (Multi-Screen Screenshot) library for optimal multi-monitor support
- **Windows**: Attempts Windows API (pywin32) first, falls back to MSS/PIL
- **Linux**: Uses MSS library as primary method
- **Unknown**: Falls back to PIL ImageGrab

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Before (Old Implementation)**
- Always tried Windows API calls first (even on macOS/Linux)
- Used error-based fallback approach
- Required pywin32 dependency on all systems
- Inefficient for non-Windows platforms

### ✅ **After (New Implementation)**
- Detects OS and chooses optimal method directly
- No unnecessary Windows API calls on macOS/Linux
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Cleaner error handling

## Performance Benefits
- **macOS**: Direct MSS usage (no Windows API attempts)
- **Windows**: Still uses optimal Windows API when available
- **Multi-monitor**: Proper support across all platforms
- **Faster startup**: No failed import attempts

## Code Structure
- `platform_capture.py`: Core platform detection and capture logic
- `color_picker.py`: Updated to use platform-aware system
- Window title now shows: "Color Picker (MacOS - MSS)"

## Dependencies by Platform
- **All platforms**: pyautogui, webcolors, Pillow, numpy, mss
- **Windows only**: pywin32 (optional, for optimal performance)
- **macOS/Linux**: No additional platform-specific dependencies

## Testing
Run `python test_platform.py` to verify platform detection and capture methods.
